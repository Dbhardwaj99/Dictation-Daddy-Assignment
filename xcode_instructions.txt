To complete the setup for using the .xcconfig file, you need to do the following in your Xcode project:

1.  **Set the Configuration File in Build Settings:**
    *   In the Xcode Project Navigator, select your project.
    *   Select the 'Dictation-Daddy' target.
    *   Go to the 'Build Settings' tab.
    *   Find the 'Configurations' section.
    *   For each configuration (e.g., Debug, Release), expand the settings and find 'Based on Configuration File'.
    *   Set the value to 'Config' for each configuration. This links your `Config.xcconfig` file.

2.  **Add the API Key to Info.plist:**
    *   Open your `Info.plist` file for the 'Dictation-Daddy' app.
    *   Add a new row.
    *   Set the 'Key' to `GroqAPIKey` (the same key used in `NetworkManager.swift`).
    *   Set the 'Value' to `$(GROQ_API_KEY)`. The `$(...)` syntax tells Xcode to substitute the value from the `.xcconfig` file at build time.

After these steps, your app will securely load the API key from the `Config.xcconfig` file, which is now ignored by Git.
